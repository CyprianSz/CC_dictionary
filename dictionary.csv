function;A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm
parameter;A named entity in a function (or method) definition that specifies an argument(or in some cases, arguments) that the function can accept.;https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter
variable;Variables are reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variableyou reserve some space in memory. Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocatesmemory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning differentdata types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm
argument;A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function.;https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html
dictionary;A Dictionary (or "dict") is a way to store data just like a list, but instead of usingonly numbers to get the data, you can use almost anything. This lets you treat a dict like it's a databasefor storing and organizing data.;https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html
tuple;A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuplesuse parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm
ASCII;Acronym for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Pronounced ask-ee, ASCII is a codefor representing English characters as numbers, with each letter assigned a number from 0 to 127.For example, the ASCII code for uppercase M is 77. Most computers use ASCII codesto represent text, which makes it possible to transfer datafrom one computer to another.;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/ASCII.html
module;A module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables.A module can also include runnable code.;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm
list;The list type is a container that holds a number of other objects, in a given order. The list type implements the sequence protocol, and also allows you to add and remove objects from the sequence.;http://effbot.org/zone/python-list.htm
loop;A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements: while loop, for loop, nested loops;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loops.htm
string;String store characters and have many built-in convenience methods that let you modify their content.Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed in place.;https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-python
class;A template for creating user-defined objects. Class definitions normally containmethod definitions that operate on instances of the class.;https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
immutable;An object with fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and tuples.Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored.;https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
regular expression;A formula for matching strings that follow some pattern. Regular expressions are made up of normal characters and metacharacters.In the simplest case, a regular expression looks like a standard search string.;https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
object;Any data with state (attributes or value) and defined behavior (methods).;https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
